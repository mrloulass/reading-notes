# Code 201 Day 2 Reading

## Lists

HTML has three types of list: ordered, unordered and definition.

- **Ordered Lists** uses numbers to list items. Ordered list use tags `<ol> </ol>` with `<li> </li>` inside the element. 

- **Unordered Lists** uses bullets to list items. Unordered list use tags `<ul> </ol>` with `<li> </li>` inside the element.

- **Definition Lists** are used to define terminology. Definition list use tags `<dl> </dl>` with the series of terms and their definitions. The terms use `<dt>` tags and their definitions use `<dd> tags.

*List can be nested inside each other*

## Boxes 

CSS treats each HTML element as has its own box. CSS also can control the dimensions of a box by using `width` and `height`. You can limit the width and height by using `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height`. The `overflow` if the informantion in the the box is larger than the box. You can use the values: `overflow:hidden;` to hide extra content that does not fit or `overflow:scroll;` that adds a scrollbar to see the rest of the content.

Boxes has three properties that can adjusted to control appearance:

- **Border** separates the edge of one box from another. You can change the border width, style and color. 

- **Margin** sits outside of the border and controls the gap between boxes.

- **Padding** is the space between the border of the box and any content contained with it.

You can change inline elements to box-level or vic versa. Use `display:inline;` or `display:block;`. You can hide elements by using `display:none;`.

CSS has the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions (Review)

**Arrays** does not store one value, it stores multiple of values.

- Example `var colors = ['white', 'black', 'red'];`

## Decisions and Loops

**If** statements evaluates the condition and if the condition is true the code block runs.

**If...else** statements allow you to run one set of code if the condition is true and nother if it is false.

**Switch** statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes and a default of none match.

**Loops** check the condition and if it is true, a code block will run. The loop keeps running until the return is false. 

Three types of Loops:

1. **For** if you need to run code specific of times

2. **While** if you don't know how many times a code should run. It runs as long as the condition is true.

3. **Do...While** will run if the statement is false.
