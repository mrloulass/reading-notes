## Lists

HTML has three types of list: ordered, unordered and definition.

- **Ordered Lists** uses numbers to list items. Ordered list use tags `<ol> </ol>` with `<li> </li>` inside the element. 

- **Unordered Lists** uses bullets to list items. Unordered list use tags `<ul> </ol>` with `<li> </li>` inside the element.

- **Definition Lists** are used to define terminology. Definition list use tags `<dl> </dl>` with the series of terms and their definitions. The terms use `<dt>` tags and their definitions use `<dd> tags.

*List can be nested inside each other*

## Boxes 

CSS treats each HTML element as has its own box. CSS also can control the dimensions of a box by using `width` and `height`. You can limit the width and height by using `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height`. The `overflow` if the informantion in the the box is larger than the box. You can use the values: `overflow:hidden;` to hide extra content that does not fit or `overflow:scroll;` that adds a scrollbar to see the rest of the content.
