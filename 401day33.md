### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe use cases for `useMemo()` and `useReducer()`
  - `useMemo()` Returns a memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.
    - You may rely on useMemo as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee.

  - `useReducer()` is usually preferable to `useState` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
    - Lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

2. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

  - itâ€™s just like a normal function. Its name should always start with "use" so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.

3. What do custom hooks usually do?

  - Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

4. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
  - `react-use-form-state hook` allows us to manage a form's state. This would be great in  our lab when we are using forms for theme, login and user infor.

5. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
  - A custom hook to be used in functional components for data fetching. The custom hook memoizes against the URL where the data will be fetched from, by passing the `url` param to the dependency array. useEffcect will always run when a new URL is passed.

### Terms

- reducer: s a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change.
