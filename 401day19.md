# Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## 401 Reading Notes: Class 19

### Readings: AWS: Events

Building blocks for  modern app on the cloud  
  - Compute, Database, Messaging

  Messaging is when two software send a message to each other
    
    - Example would be a Queue
    
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS): 

- standard Queue: allow you to scale your queue when traffic grows

- FIFO Queue: not scalable, but organize your data in order

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server 

  - Express is commonly used for both web applications as well as REST APIs.
  - API Gateway function is to deliver APIs, it can certainly be used for delivering web apps/sites (HTML) as well
  - Express application onto API Gateway using AWS Lambda functions.

2. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
  - Con: Weak querying model. Global and Secondary Indexes can only get you so far.
  - Pro: Non-hourly billing model.
  - Con: Harder to predict costs. 
  - Pro: Streams. 
  - Con: Lack of server-side updates. 
  - Pro: Time-to-Live. 
  - Con: Provisioned throughput and batch jobs don't work well together.

3. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

  - standard Queue: allow you to scale your queue when traffic grows

  - FIFO Queue: not scalable, but organize your data in order

4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

  - by sending a status response back to the orginal request with status code 

### Terms

Serverless API: event-​driven setup without permanent infrastructure

Triggers: is a Lambda resource or a resource in another service that you configure to invoke your function in response to lifecycle events, external requests, or on a schedule. 

Dynamo vs Mongo: 
- MongoDB is vendor agnostic, Open Source, and can be deployed anywhere. DynamoDB is only available on AWS.
- DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas.
- DynamoDB as an integrated AWS service makes it easier to develop end to end solutions.
- DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents.
- DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions. [source](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/dynamodb-vs-mongodb-differences/)

Dynamoose vs Mongoose: 
- Dynamoose works with AWS DynamoDB like Mongoose workins with Mongodb and Node.js
- Dynamoose is cloud base 
- Mongoose works on software on your computer
