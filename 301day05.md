### Readings: Putting it all together

**[Thinking In React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)**

#### Start With A Mock

- Draw out the web page and the different parts on the site
  
  * Tools to help or try like 
  
    - [BuilderX](https://builderx.io/) 

    - Bashooka has an article for: [10 Useful Tools to Create Website frop Mockup](https://bashooka.com/coding/10-useful-tools-to-create-website-from-mockup/)

    - [Anima](https://www.animaapp.com/)

#### Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

- Draw boxes around every component and subcomponent (parent and child). Give them all name.

- Use the techniques for deciding if you create a new function or object. A component should do one thing and if it grows add subcomponents. **[Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)**

- Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.

#### Step 2: Build A Static Version in React

- You have your component hierarchy now it's time to build your app. The built should take your data and render but no interactivity

- You’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using **[props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)**. DON'T USE **[state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)** AT ALL when building static version. State is reserved only for interactivity

- You can build top-down or bottom-up(parent to child or child to parent). This depends on the project and size of the project.

- You’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app. React’s one-way data flow keeps everything modular and fast.

#### Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

- Now you can use **state** to make your UI interactive 

- Think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. KEEP IT **[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)**. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand

- Ask yourself these questions to see if each piece of data is state or props:

  1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

#### Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

- Follow these steps to figure it out where state should live. 
   
   - For each piece of state in your application:

      * Identify every component that renders something based on that state.

      * Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

      * Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

      * If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the
          state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

#### Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow

- Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in the parent component.
