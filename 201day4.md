## 6 Reasons for [Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.
There are two roles the driver and navigator. The driver types the code and the navigator use their words to guide drive.

1. Greater efficiency: by producing higher-quality of code and less issues with troubleshooting and debugging 

2. Engaged collaboration: allow both programmers to stay focuse  and rely on each other to solution together

3. Learning from fellow students: allow programmers to learn different techniques from each other

4. Social skills: help build interpersonal skills and improve communications

5. Job interview readiness: the ability to work with and learn from others and great communication skills help with interviews.

6. Work environment readiness: many companies untilize pair programming already, so you will be ready
