### Readings: NODE.JS

#### [An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

1. What is node.js?

- from [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/):
  > Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

- from [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/node.js/info):
  > Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O (input/output) runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript Engine.

- from [Community.ibm.com](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/groups/topic-home?CommunityKey=dd64b79b-2641-4911-a0bf-e687936a2a45):
  > Node.js is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. This popular server platform is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and enables you to use JavaScript code outside of a browser.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
  - V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome. It helps to compile JavaScript to native machine code that your computer can execute. This is what Node.js runs on while in a runtime environment.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
  - enables you to use JavaScript code outside of a browser.
  - Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers

4. What is npm?
  - a package manager that comes bundled with Node
  - npm is also the world’s largest software registry.
  - there are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
  - v12.19.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
  - 7.7.6

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint'?
  - `npm install -g jshint`

8. What is node used for?
  - runtime that allows server-side programs to be written in JavaScript
  - running JavaScript on the server.

#### [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  - Greater efficiency
  - Engaged collaboration
  - Learning from fellow students
  - Social skills
  - Job interview readiness
  - Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  - In my experience: 
      - **greater efficiency** has improve how long it takes me to code ,errors have been caught quickly
      - **learning from fellow students** from keyboard shortcuts, how to break down concepts and how to explain concepts to other peer

3. How does pair programming work?
  - pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator
  - Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard
  - Driver manages the text editor, switching files and version control
  - Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver
  - Navigator thinks about an algorithm, scan for typos or bugs and looks for solutions and documentation
