# Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## 401 Reading Notes: Class 29

### Readings: Advanced State with Reducers

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?
    - add a second  parameter to the effect hook
    - Example 
      ```javascript
      function App() {

        useEffect(() => {
        // Run! Like go get some data from an API.
      }, []);

      }
      ```
2. Can `useState()` update more than one state variable at the same time?
  - No, On multiple useState() calls, the invocation order must be the same between renderings.

3. Is `useState()` synchronous?
  - No, `useState()` is asynchronous

### Terms

- State Hook: let you use state and other React features without writing a class with a function component

- Component Lifecycle: These methods are called the component's lifecycle methods and they are invoked in a predictable order. Basically all the React component's lifecyle methods can be split in four phases: **initialization**, **mounting**, **updating** and **unmounting**.
