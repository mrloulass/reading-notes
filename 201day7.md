## [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

*What is Domain Modeling*

 :is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

 ***Example: use a constructor function***

Tips when building your own domain models

1. build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors

2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties

3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well

4. Create instances using the `new` keyword followed by a call to a constructor function

5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside

6. Use the `this` variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside 

## Tables 

*What is a Table?*

  :A table represents information in a grid format on a web page. Examples:(financial reports, TV schedules and sports results) In HTML a table is wrritten out row by row.

The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page

A table is drawn out row by row. A `<tr>`element create a row.

Inside the row are a number of cells represented by the `<td>` element or `<th>` element for the header

If you don't put any data between open and close element of `<td>` or `<th>` it is left empty. Example `<td></td>`

When using `<th>` use **scope** attribute to indicate whether it is a header for the column(**col**) or **row**. 
Example `<th scope="col">header name</th>`

You make cells of a table span more than row or column using the **rowspan** and **colspan** attributes

For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>`

## Functions, Methods and Objects

### Objects

#### Object Literals

*What is an Object?*

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of anything that you can recognize  from the real world. In an Objects the variables and function are name differently
1. variable is called **property**
2. function is called **method**

example of an Object:

```JavaScript
let home = {
  location: 'Seattle',
  floors: 3,
  color: 'bluegreen',
  houseType:['townhome','high rise', 'single family'],
  checkColor: function(){
    return this.color;
  }
};
```
#### Object: Constructor Notation

The ***new*** keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. Now you can add properties and methods to the object

Example of adding 

```JavaScript
let home = new Object();
  home.location = 'Oakland';
  home.floors = 1;
  home.color = 'brick';
  home.checkColor = function(){
  return this.color;
};
```
You use the keyword ***delete*** to delete a property

You can create many objects with constructor notation  using a function

Example of this

```JavaScript
function Home(location, floors, color){
  this.location = location;
  this.floors = floors;
  this.colors = colors;
  this.checkColor = function(){
  return this.color;
};
}
```
You can create instances of the object using the constructor function

Example of this

```JavaScript
let laHome = new Home('LA', 3, 'yellow');
let dcHome = new Home('DC', 2, 'green');
```
#### Three Groups of Built-In Objects

*What is a Built-In Object?*

  : different range of tools that help you write scripts for web pages

- Browser Object Model

- Document Object Model

- Global JavaScript Objects
