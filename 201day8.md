# Code 201 Day 8 Reading

Key Concepts in positioning elements

* Building Blocks - CSS treats each HTML element as its own box. The box can be **block-level** or **inline box**. You can control the space on each box with **width** and **height**. To separate boxes you can use **borders**, **margins**, **padding** and **background colors**.

- Block-Level elements start a new line and act like a building blocks of any layout Example: `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>`

- Inline elements flow in between surrounding text. Example: `<img>, <b>, <i>`

* Containing elements - One block-level sits inside another block-level then the outer box is known as the containing or **parent element**.

* Normal Flow - `position:static` - each block element sits on top of the next one. This is the browser default setting for block elements.

* Relative Positioning - `position:relative` - moves an element box in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. 

* Absolute Positioning - `position:absolute` - the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of the other elements on the page.

* Fixed Positioning - `position:fixed` - when the user scrolls down a page the element stays in the exact same place.

* Overlapping Elements - `z-index` - boxes can overlap each other. You use z-index the closer the element is move to the front.

* Overlapping Elements - Without Z-Index

* Floating Elements - `float` - allow you to take an element in normal flow and place it to the far right or left of the containing element.

* Using Float to Place Elements Side-by-Side - this might work better for page layout than `display:inline`. try both to see which work better

* Clearing Floats - `clear` - with in the same element container you have no element touch the left or right side of each other

* A Fixed Width Layout - designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window

* A Liquid Layout - designs stretch and contract a the user increases or decreases the size of the browser

* A Grid-Based Layout Using 960.gs - web designers use a grid srtucture to help them position items on a page.

* Multiple Style Sheets: `@import` - you can import multiple style sheets in CSS

* Multiple Style Sheets: `link` - you can add a link in the head of the HTML file to add multiple style sheets
