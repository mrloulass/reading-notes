## 401 Reading Notes: Class 13

### Readings: Message Queues

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?

- WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication. This enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time. [source](https://www.amx.com/en/site_elements/benefits-and-applications-of-websockets)

2. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?

- Socket.io, and WebSockets in general, require an http server for the initial upgrade handshake. So even if you don't supply Socket.io with an http server it will create one for you.[source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33188147/socket-io-without-http-server)

3. What happens when a client emits an event?

- a server will listen for events emitted by the client

4. What happens when a server emits an event?

-  the client will listen for events emitted by the server

5. What happens if a client "misses" an event?

- The client will not be able to listen for the event and the information can be lost.

6. How can we mitigate this?

- By Implementing Message Queues: The Queue server is tasked with receiving any published message and then distributing it out to all connected and subscribed clients. It must further ensure that subscribed clients can "catch up" and pull down any messages that they might have missed during a period of disconnection with the server

### Terms

- Socket: A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 

- Web Socket: WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. 

- Socket.io: Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

- Client: The clients run programs and access data that are stored on the server.

- Server: A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

- OSI Model: The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.

- TCP Model: The TCP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model

- TCP: The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets. 

- UDP: The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups.

- Packets: A packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them.
