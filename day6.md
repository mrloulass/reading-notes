# Day 6 Reading notes

## Intro to JavaScript

JavaScript make websites more interactive.
1. **access content** to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
2. **modify content** to add or remove element, attribute, and text to a page.
3. **program rules** you can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow. This allows you to access or change content on web sites.
4. **react to events** you can specify that a script should run base on specific event

Examples would be having slideshows, forms, reload parts of a page or filter data.

A **Script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow step-by-step and execute. 
A script can be like a recipes, handbooks or manuals

Writing a Script
- define the goal: what do you want the computer to solve
- design the script: break up your goal in series of task that can solve a puzzle. use a flowchart to do this.
- code each step: each steps needs to be written in code aka JavaScript.

**Expressions** evalutes into a single value.
1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable 
 - Ex. (Var color = 'beige';) the value of colr is now beige
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
 - Ex. (var area = 3 * 2;) the value of the area is now 6

**Operators** allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
1. assignment
2. arithmetic
3. string
4. comparsion
5. logical


**Function** let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task or code block.
1. first call the function by give it a name
 - Ex: function callName(){
     *add code block*;
 }
 2. add code or blocks of code betwenn{}
 3. if you add parameters you must have a return value
 4. last define the function by adding the function name after }
  - Ex: callName();


- OR Operators are possible with '2 pipes' ||
- || double pipes equal the OR Orperator
- Or Operator only one value has to be true

- double ampersand && is the And Operatior
- in an And Operation both values have to be true
