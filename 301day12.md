**SQL vs NoSQL: Differences**

| SQL databases                                                             	| NoSQL database                                                                                                     	|
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Relational Databases (RDBMS)                                              	| non-relational or distributed database.                                                                            	|
| represent data in form of tables                                          	| collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores                                     	|
| predefined schema                                                         	| dynamic schema for unstructured data                                                                               	|
| vertically scalable                                                       	| horizontally scalable                                                                                              	|
| scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware                      	| scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.                            	|
| SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, 	| UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) focused on collection of documents                                              	|
| examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL                      	| examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb                                   	|
| Great for complex queries                                                 	| not great for complex queries                                                                                      	|
| not best fit for hierarchical data storage                                	| better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data 	|
| best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications                   	| not best for heavy duty transactional apps                                                                         	|
| Excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors   	| rely on community support, and only limited outside experts                                                        	|
| ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability)       	| Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )                                          	|
