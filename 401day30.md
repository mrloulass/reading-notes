### Reading: Implementation: Hash Tables

#### What are Hash Tables?

- Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs.The ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. 

- This is done through what we call a `hash`. A `hash` is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

- the hash function takes a key and returns an integer. We use the integer to determine where the key/value pair should be placed in the array

4 steps To create a Hash:
  1. determine the number of buckets in our table
    - Typically this is a power of 2. We'll go with 1024 by convention
  2. Convert the string to it's ASCII values
    - 'J' = 74 'a' = 97 'c' = 99  'o' = 111   'b' = 98 ====> 479
  3. Multiply the results by some largest prime number
    - 599 * 479  === 286921
  4. Take the and modulo by the size out table
    - 286921 % 1024 === 201

#### Why do we use Hash Tables?

1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library

#### How to use hash Tables?

The methods for HashTables
- add()
- find()
- contains()
- getHash()


### Terms

- Hash: A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.

- Buckets: A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
