### Reading: Custom Hooks

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does a componentâ€™s lifecycle refer to?

  - Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM).

2. Why do you sometimes need to "wrap" functions in `useCallback` when called from within `useEffect`

  - It tells React to not re-create a wrapped function when a component re-renders, unless any of the useCallback's dependencies change.

3. Why are functional components preferred over class components?

  - Functional component are much easier to read and test because they are plain JavaScript functions without state or lifecycle-hooks. You end up with less code. 

4. What is wrong with the following code?

  - The code looks correct, useState and useEffect are being use correctly
    ```javascript
    import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

    function MyComponent(props) {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      function changeCount(e) {
        setCount(e.target.value);
      }

      let renderedItems = []

      for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        useEffect( () => {
          console.log('component mount/update');
        }, [count]);

        renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
      }

      return (<div>
        <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
          {renderedItems}
        </div>);
    }
    ```
### Terms

- state hook: let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

- effect hook: is the hook that manages the side-effects in functional components. callback argument is a function to put the side-effect logic. dependencies is a list of dependencies of your side-effect: being props or state values.

- reducer hook: a function that returns some state data, triggered by an action type.
