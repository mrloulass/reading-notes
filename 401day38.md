### Reading: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How granular should your reducers be?
  - The more UI components subscribed to the Redux store and reading data at a more granular level, leads to better UI performance, as fewer components will need to render when a given piece of state changes.

2. Pro or Con â€“ multiple reducers can "fire" when a commonly named action is dispatched
  - Pro: Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object. Because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior.

3. Name a strategy for preventing the above
  - Redux provides the `combineReducers` utility to implement that behavior. It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.

### Terms

- store: holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.

- combined reducers: helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to `createStore`.
