### Readings: Access Control (ACL)

Access control lists (ACL) is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document. 

#### What is access control?

*Access Control dictates who’s allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data.*

##### Four main types access control:

  - Discretionary access control (DAC)
    - the owner or administrator of the protected system, data, or resource sets the policies for who is allowed access.

  - Mandatory access control (MAC) 
    - in this nondiscretionary model, people are granted access based on an information clearance. A central authority regulates access rights based on different security levels. It’s common in government and military environments. 

  - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
    - In this dynamic method, access is based on a set of attributes and environmental conditions, such as time of day and location, assigned to both users and resources. 

  - Role-based access control (RBAC) 
    - RBAC grants access based on defined business functions rather than the individual user’s identity. The goal is to provide users with access only to data that’s been deemed necessary for their role within the organizations. This widely used method is based on a complex combination of role assignments, authorizations, and permissions. 

    - Benefits of RBAC is the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

    - RBAC implementation:
      1. Inventory your systems
      2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
      3. Assign people to roles
      4. Never make one-off changes
      5. Audit

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

  - Basic authentication method is useful when you need to check identity (user/password) and get the data in one call. Then the server will generate a bearer token that will then be used to get the data. [source: Basic Auth vs. Bearer Token](https://community.mega.com/t5/REST-API/Basic-Auth-vs-Bearer-Token/td-p/23476)

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?

  - JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. [source: Introduction to JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction)

3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

  1. Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories. Avoid git add commands on git. Add sensitive files in .gitignore. 
  2. Don't share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems like slack.
  3. Store secrets safely.
  4. Restrict API access and permissions.

### Terms

- encryption: translates data into another code, so that only people with access to a secret key or password can access the data.

- token: is a piece of data that help secure your app by ensuring that each request to a server is accompanied by a signed token which the server verifies for authenticity and only then responds to the request.

- bearer: is a process of granting or denying access to resources.

- secret: is a long random string used to encrypt and decrypt the data [source: How To Use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in Express.js](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-jwt-expressjs)

- JSON Web Token: allow authorization and information exchange between two parties.
