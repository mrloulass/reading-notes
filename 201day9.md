## Events

Different event types occur in the browser while you are browsing the web. These events can be used to trigger a function in your JavaScript code.

Terms
- **fired** or **raised** - when a event hass occurred
- **trigger** - when a event is fire and a script is trigger in JavaScript

*How events trigger JavaScript code?*

There are three steps to trigger JavaScript this process is called **event handling**
  1. select element nodes you want the script to respond to (check Chapter 5 for DOM query)
  2. indicate which event on the selected nodes will trigger the respones - **binding** an event to a DOM node
  3. state the code you want to run when the event occurs.

The ways to bind an event to an element
 - Traditonal DOM event handlers - one function to each event handler
 - DOM level 2 event listeners - allow one event to trigger multiple functions
