### Readings:

1. [Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

*What is functional programming?*: a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

 - Pure Functions: returns the same result if given the same arguments. It is easier to test.

 - Immutability: its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

 - Referential transparency: is when you add **pure functions** with **immutable data**

 - Functions as first-class entities: are functions that are treated as values and used as data.
   
    * refer to it from constants and variables
    
    * refer to it from constants and variables
   
    * return it as result from other functions

 - Higher-order functions: are functions that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. Examples: filter, map and reduce methods.

    * Filter(): method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function)

    * Map(): method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values

    * Reduce(): method receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.

  - Strategies

    * Return early from functions

    * Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences

    * Check for Web APIs before implementing your own functionality
