### Readings: Authentication

#### 1. [What is OAuth?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html)

- **OAuth** is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.

- Example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website's or service's logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.

- Example OAuth scenario could be a user sending cloud-stored files to another user via email, when the cloud storage and email systems are otherwise unrelated other than supporting the OAuth framework (Ex: Google Gmail and Microsoft OneDrive).

- For OAuth to work, the end-user's client software (Ex:a browser), the services involved and authentication provider must support the right version of OAuth 1.0 or 2.0.

- OAuth is an authorization 

*What is Authorization?* is the process of letting a subject access resources after a successful authentication
 
- OAuth vs. OpenID

  - OAuth: authorization: machines logging into machines on behalf of humans

  - OpenID: authentication: humans logging into machines

- OAuth vs. SAML

  - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) SAML describes a framework that allows one computer to perform both authentication and authorization on behalf of one or more other computers

  - OAuth requires an additional layer like OpenID Connect to perform authentication

- [Whatâ€™s the difference? OAuth 1.0 vs OAuth 2.0](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/oauth-2-0-vs-oauth-1-0/)

- Is OAuth safe?

  - If OAuth uses a Transport Layer Security (TLS) an outside protection protocol, can provide more protections. Coders and 
  users should look to ensure that OAuth is running inside of TLS protection. Developers can implement code to enforce TLS use 
  and users should be aware that TLS is being used whenever they are begin asked to input authentication credentials.

#### 2. [Authentication and Authorization Flows Docs](https://auth0.com/docs/flows)

- Auth0 uses the OpenID Connect (OIDC) Protocol and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework to authenticate users and get their 
authorization to access protected resources. With Auth0, you can easily support different flows in your own applications and 
APIs without worrying about OIDC/OAuth 2.0 specifications or other technical aspects of authentication and authorization.

- Authentication
  1. Determines whether users are who they claim to be
  2. Challenges the user to validate credentials (Ex: through passwords, answers to security questions, or facial recognition)
  3. Usually done before authorization
  4. Generally, transmits info through an ID Token
  5. Generally governed by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol
  6. Ex: Employees in a company are required to authenticate through the network before accessing their company email

- Authorization
  1. Determines what users can and cannot access
  2. Verifies whether access is allowed through policies and rules
  3. Usually done after successful authentication
  4. Generally, transmits info through an Access Token
  5. Generally governed by the OAuth 2.0 framework
  6. Ex: After an employee successfully authenticates, the system determines what information the employees are allowed to access

- Authorization Code Flow is use for regular web apps that are server-side apps where the source code is not publicly exposed can which exchanges an Authorization Code for a token.

- OAuth 2.0 provides a version of the Authorization Code Flow which makes use of a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

- As an alternative to the Authorization Code Flow, OAuth 2.0 provides the Implicit Flow, which is intended for Public Clients, or applications which are unable to securely store Client Secrets.

- Hybrid Flow, which combines features of the Authorization Code Flow and Implicit Flow with Form Post to allow your application to have immediate access to an ID token while still providing for secure and safe retrieval of access and refresh tokens. 

- Client Credentials Flow is use for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications

- Device Authorization Flow is use when input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device.

- Not recommend it, highly-trusted applications can use the Resource Owner Password Flow, which requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form. The Resource Owner Password Flow should only be used when redirect-based flows (like the Authorization Code Flow) cannot be used.

#### 3. [Auth0 Single React SDK for Single Page Apps Docs](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-react)

- The Auth0 React SDK (auth0-react.js) is a JavaScript library for implementing authentication and authorization in React apps with Auth0. It provides a custom React hook and other Higher Order Components so you can secure React apps using best practices while writing less code.

- The Auth0 React SDK handles grant and protocol details, token expiration and renewal, as well as token storage and caching. Under the hood, it implements Universal Login and the Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE.
