## [CSS Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

**Transform** alternative ways to size, position and change elements.

*browser support for the **transform** property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged* 

```{
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```
*The **transform** property includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. The un-prefixed declaration comes last to overwrite the prefixed versions, should a browser fully support the transform property.*

1. Transform two-dimensional (2D Transforms): Two-dimensional **transforms** work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes.

- Transform Values

    - rotate: value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise.
    `transform: rotate(20deg);` or `transform: rotate(-55deg);`

    - scale: value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. To scale only the height or width of an element using the scaleX and scaleY values.
    `transform: scaleX(.5);`, `transform: scaleY(1.15);` or `transform: scale(.5, 1.15);`

    - translate:value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Any general length measurement, most commonly pixels or percentages. Positive values will push an element down and to the right of its default position while negative values will pull an element up and to the left of its default position.
    `transform: translateX(-10px);`, `transform: translateY(25%);` or `transform: translate(-10px, 25%);`

    - skew: used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. The value is measured in units of degrees.
    `transform: skewX(5deg);`, `transform: skewY(-20deg);`, or `transform: skew(5deg, -20deg);`

    *To combine **transforms**, list the **transform** values within the **transform** property one after the other without the use of commas.* `transform: rotate(25deg) scale(.75);`

2. Transform three-dimensional (3D Transforms): can change elements on the x, y, and z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

- Transform Values

    - 3D Rotate: includes the values rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.

    - 3D Scale: elements may be scaled on the z axis

    - 3D Translate: a negative value here will push an element further away on the z axis, resulting in a smaller element. Using a positive value will pull an element closer on the z axis, resulting in a larger element.

    - 3D Skew: **cannot** be transformed on a three-dimensional scale. Elements may be skewed on the x and y axis, then transformed three-dimensionally as wished, but they cannot be skewed on the z axis.



## [CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

**Transitions**: element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

*There are four transition related properties*

    - Transitional Property
    - Transition Duration
    - Transition Timing
    - Transition Delay

**Animations**: when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. Animations pick up where transitions leave off. To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the **@keyframes** rule. The **@keyframes** rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

- Animation Name
- Animation Duration, Timing Function, & Delay
- Animation Iteration
- Animation Direction
- Animation Play State
- Animation Fill Mode

## [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

This ia a New York Times article about how Google and their researchers spent time and money to build the perfect team. They wanted to know why some groups thrive and others falter. The article begins with the researcher Julia Rozovsky and her experience with different groups when she was in Yale. The study group had people with the same experience and education but didn't work well together. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another’s ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class. People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other. This gave Rozovsky stress and put her on edge. The second group was very diverse with education and work experience but they work well with each other. The second group joke, took ten minutes to chat about life and get to know each other personally. A few years later Rozovsky is working at Googel and researching why some teams do well and others don't.

    "As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. One study, published in The Harvard Business Review last month, found that ‘‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’ over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues."

    "In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together."

Google began Project Aristotle’s researchers to find the pattern or norms of teams, to see what works. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather. The researchers could not find the right patterns or norms to help build a perfect team.

    "Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’"

    "What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor."

What they learned that the best teams have members that listen to one another and show sensitivity to each other needs and feelings. Google found the method for talking about insecurities, fears and aspirations in a constructive way. They have the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers decades to absorb. Google in its race to build the perfect team, has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways.
