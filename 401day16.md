## 401 Reading Notes: Class 16

### Readings: AWS: Cloud Servers

#### What is a Virtual Machine?

  - It is a type of software that allows us to run an operating syatem within another operating system. 
    - Examples are Virtual Box and VMWare

  - Why use a virtual machine
    - trying a new operating system
    - testing an application
    - running old applications

#### Introduction to Virtualization - Virtualization and Cloud Computing

  - What is Virtualization?
    - Hypervisor - Software allowing us to create Virtual Machines (VMs)

  - What is Cloud Computing?
    - you are using the server's software and resources remotly from home, work or school.

#### Amazon EC2

  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

#### EC2 for Humans | Amazon Web Services BASICS

Amazon Web Service Console
- Compute
  - EC2
    - click Launch Instance (to Create a virtual server)
      - 1. choose an Amazon Machine Image(AMI) (choosing an OS software)
      - 2. choose an Instance Type (choosing a virtual servers hardware component)
        - (m) multipurpose, great for all type of task
        - (c) compute, great for computing calculations
        - (t) gives you credit for low traffic and can use those credits when your site traffic spike up.
      - 3. configure instance 
      - 4. Add storage (use AWS EBS(Elastic Block Storage)) extra storage to save any data, if you shutdown the instance
      - 5. Add Tags
      - 6. Configure Security Group (swith traffic can access the instance or leave like a firewall)
      - 7. Review Instance and Launch


#### Introduction to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

  - deploys, manages, and scales web apps and services for you

  - uses managed containers that supprt environments like (Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Python and Docker)

  - on servers  like apache, HTTP, apache tomcat, nginx passenger and i is

  - leverages familiar AWS services (Amazon EC2, S3, SNS, elastic load balancing, auto scaling)

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

  - ![WRRC Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/490/1*bx2bWzqeKCBndthiLGMK5g.png)

  - The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers. [source](https://medium.com/@jen_strong/the-request-response-cycle-of-the-web-1b7e206e9047)

2. Explain what a "server" is, as it relates to the WRRC

  - All resources are hosted on a server. The server's location on the web can be identified by its IP address and we use URLS to search for a resource.

  - Once the client’s request has reached the server, the server will search for and return the information the client is requesting. This means querying a database, loading the information into an html page, and returning the HTML text to the user in the body of the HTTP response.

3. What does it mean to "deploy" an application?

  - Software deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device. Software deployment refers to the process of making the application work on a target device, whether it be a test server, production environment or a user's computer or mobile device.

### Terms

- Server: A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

- Pub/Sub: Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic. Pub/sub messaging can be used to enable event-driven architectures, or to decouple applications in order to increase performance, reliability and scalability.
