## Images

### How to add images to pages

- use `<img>` element to add a image and with no closing tag. It must carry the following two attributes: **src** and **alt**
  **src** tells the browser where it can find the image file
  **alt** this provides a text description of the image

- You can place your image any where on your code
  1. before a paragraph (or block elements)
  2. inside the start of the paragraph (or inline elements)
  3. in the middle of the paragraph (or inline elements)

### Choosing the right format

- use **JPEG** if the image has different kind of colors like hi-res photos
- use **GIF** or **PNG** if the image has few colors or flat colors like logos, illustrations and diagrams

### Optimizing images for the web

- The images you use on your website should be save at the same width and height has your website. Example, if you design your images on your page is 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall the image should be 300 x 150 pixels.

- When sizing an image for use on the screen set dimensions of the image in terms of pixels.

## Color

### How to specify colors

- Three ways to specify colors in CSS
  1. RGB values - how much red, green and blue are use Ex: rgb(100,100,90)
  2. hex codes - six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue Ex: #ee#e80
  3. color names - there are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by bowsers Ex: yellow, orange or green
