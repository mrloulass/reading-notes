## Review

- Basic Authentication: username/password (strings)

  1. use base64 encode (23djk78dhk34)
  2. What part of the request contains the encoded string?
    1. Get's sent through the `request.headers` in an `Authorization` in a form of JSON's?

- Bearer Authentication: token based
  - Once you have signed in, the User model can issues a token

- Creating a User Module with  authentication functions

  - authBasic: decodes the base64 encoded, compare the decoded (normal unencrypted) password with the encrtpted password from the datatbase. 
    - bcrypt compares plain password to encrypted string.

  - authBearer

  - Token: jsonwebtoken, contained encoded user info, and is signed with a `SECRET`.
    - Secret is like a `key` for an object.
      - when we `sign` the token, we add our encoded to a list that jsonwebtoken manages for us.
      - when we `verify`, jsonwebtoken looks up our list of tokens, and checks if the verified token is there

  - Capailities / Role (Permissions)
    - Specific a role when we create the User (this is specified on `POST/signup`)
    - role: user, writer, editor, adim
      - role type, specifices a list of capabilities in our Virtual field
      - create an object literal, keys are role types, and values are a list of capabilities.
      - VIRTUAL field function maps the role to the list of capabilities and returns them

- Access Control List 
  - Middleware function gets a (capability)
    - validates capabilites with the User model
