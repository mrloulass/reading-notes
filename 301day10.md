# Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development

## 301 Reading Notes: Class 10

### Readings:

1. [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)

  - *What is the call stack?*: data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

  - LIFO: that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

  - Temporarily store: When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.

  - Manage function invocation (call): The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

**Key takeaways of Call Stacks** 

  * It can do one thing at a time.

  * Code execution is synchronous.

  * A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.

  * Last In, First Out data structure (LIFO)

2. [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

  ![Sample of an Error](https://miro.medium.com/max/3360/1*LHpmsxV3f2znpxhuAFuIqA.png)

    - the green is the overall error message

    - the light blue is to note if the error was properly handled

    - the brownish (dark yellow) is the type of error

    - the red is the call stack

  **Types of error messages**

    - Reference errors: when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

    - Syntax errors: using, having or missing a syntax in your code.

    - Range errors: when trying to pass a number as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes that number. This can be encountered when to create an array of an illegal length with the Array constructor, or when passing bad values to the numeric methods Number.

    - Type errors: show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

  **Debugging**

    - How to debug your code use?

       * console.log() the variables you want to check ,
       
       * using chrome developer tools

       * breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

  **Handling errors**

    - tryâ€¦catch: the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application in case of an error 

  **Tools to avoid runtime errors**

    - [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/) to evaluate your code as you type

    - [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) to make sure your style guide is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way
