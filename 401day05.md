### Implementation: Linked Lists

#### What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a sequence of `Nodes` that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each `Node` references the next `Node` in the link.

  - Linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially.

  - dynamic data structures can shrink and grow in memory. It doesn’t need a set amount of memory to be allocated in order to exist, and its size and shape can change, and the amount of memory it needs can change as well the memory that they use can be scattered throughout.

  - The starting point of the list is a reference to the first node, which is referred to as the head. Nearly all linked lists must have a head, because this is effectively the only entry point to the list and all of its elements, and without it, you wouldn’t know where to start! The end of the list isn’t a node, but rather a node that points to null, or an empty value.

  - Different types of linked lists

    - Singly linked lists - start at the head node, and traverse from the root until the last node, which will end at an empty null value.
    
    - Doubly linked list - reference to the next node, as well as the previous node, able to traverse our data structure not just in a single track or direction, but also backwards

    - Circular linked list - s a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.

A linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
