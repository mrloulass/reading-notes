### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

- Packets are intended to transfer data reliably and efficiently. Instead of transferring a large file as a single block of data, sending smaller packets helps ensure each section is transmitted successfully. If a packet is not received or is "dropped," only the dropped packet needs to be resent. Additionally, if a data transfer encounters network congestion due to multiple simultaneous transfers, the remaining packets can be rerouted through a less congested path.

2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

- User Datagram Protocol(UDP) is part of the TCP/IP suite of protocols used for data transferring. UDP is a known as a "stateless" protocol, meaning it doesn't acknowledge that the packets being sent have been received. For this reason, the UDP protocol is typically used for streaming media. While you might see skips in video or hear some fuzz in audio clips, UDP transmission prevents the playback from stopping completely. [source: UDP ](https://techterms.com/definition/udp)

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

- Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs,

4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

- the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.

5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

- Yes, you can use a client socket and a server socket within a single application, if you use two different ports. 

### Terms

- Observer Pattern: 
software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software. 

- Listener: is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur.

- Event Handler: code that are automatically executed when an event occurs.

- Event Driven Programming: when an Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered. A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

- Event Loop: continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run.

- Event Queue: it holds the respective callback assigned to that operation that will be executed.

- Call Stack: is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack

- Emit/Raise/Trigger: is used to fire events. We need to pass the name of the event to it as a string. We can add any number of arguments after the event name. Events with just a name are fairly limited; the other arguments allow us to send data to our listeners.

- Subscribe: is when subscribers can subscribe to publisher in a event channel or pool

- database: is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically from a computer system
