# Code 201 Day 10 Reading

## Error Handling & Debugging

- Order of execution - knowing how scripts are processed. The order of statement can be complex and cannoot complete until another statement or function has been run.

- The Stack: is when JavaScript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. When a statement needs data from another function, it stacks the new function on top of the current task.

* The Console & Dev tools: tools built into the browser that help you hunt for errors.
    
    - every web browser has Dev tools (console) and they are called different names but do the same thing.

    - console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located

* Common Problems: common sources of errors, and how to solve them.

- 7 types of error objects in the console log
    
    1. Error - other errors are all based upon this error
    
    2. SyntaxError - Syntax has not been followed
    
    3. ReferenceError - Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/within scope
    
    4. TypeError - An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced
    
    5. RangeError - Numbers not in acceptable range
    
    6. URIError - encodeURI(), decodeURI(), and similiar methods used incorrectly
    
    7. EvalError - eval() function used incorrectly

* Handling Errors: how code can deal with potential gracefully.

    - if you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the Try, Catch, Finally statements.

        Try: to execut this code

        Catch(exception): if there is an exception, run this code

        Finally: this always gets executed
