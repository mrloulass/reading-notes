# Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## 401 Reading Notes: Class 18

### Readings: AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

What is Amazon API Gateway?

  - managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

What is DynamoDB?

  - a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:
    - reliable performance even as it scales;
    - a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
    - a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.

What is Dynamoose?

  - a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are serverless functions?

  - A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier. [source](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/serverless-functions)

2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

  - 1. need a entry point to your request has a handler

  - 2. a response to an event trigger by the client

3. Describe how a CDN works

  - A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user. This helps users around the world view the same high-quality content without slow loading times.

  - Without a CDN, content origin servers must respond to every single end user request. This results in significant traffic to the origin and subsequent load, thereby increasing the chances for origin failure if the traffic spikes are exceedingly high or if the load is persistent.

  - By responding to end user requests in place of the origin and in closer physical and network proximity to the end user, a CDN offloads traffic from content servers and improves the web experience, thus benefiting both the content provider and its end users.

### Terms

- Serverless Functions: automatically and precisely allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic.

- Cloud Storage: cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service.

- CDN:  content delivery network refers to a geographically distributed group
of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
