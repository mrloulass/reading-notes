## Introducing CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

CSS help add styles to HTML elements fronts, colors, spacing and more
 
Two ways to add a CSS code: 

- **Internal** `<style>` tags adds CSS code in your HTML code in the `<head>` elements

- **External** `<link>` tags adds a link to a CSS file to stylethe webpage

*It is better to use external CSS to link to your HTML code, because if you want to make changes to your site you have one CSS file to change*

## Basic Javascript Instructions ##

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.

*How does HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together?* 

1. HTML gives the web page structure

2. CSS enhances the HTML page with backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fornts

3. JavaScript help make the web page interactive

Make JavaScript code in its own file using .js extension

Use `<script>` element in HTML page to link to the JavaScript file

**Statements** are line of code or code blocks for a script that end in a semicolon

**Commments** help explain your code and easy to read

- use `/*` for multi-line comments

- use `//` for single-line comments

**Variables** are use to store bits of information in a script

1. You need to declare the variables first

- Example: `var space;`

2. You assign the variables a value

- Example: `space = 10;`

JavaScript have different data types common and special

*Common datas*

1. Numeric data - handles numbers

2. String data - has letters and other characters

3. Boolean data - can have one or two values: true or false (on or off switch)

*Special*

1. Arrays - does not store one value, it stores multiple of values

Expressions evaluate into a single value and they use operators to calculate a value.
 
## Decisions and Loops ##

Conditonal statements allow your code to make decisions about to do next.
You can compare your

**Using Comparison Operator**

Logical Operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator

If...else statements allow you to run one set of code if the condition is true and nother if it is false.
