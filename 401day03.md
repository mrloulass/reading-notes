#### Classes

  - What are Classes?
    :A template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

  - Defining classes
    - Class declarations
      :To declare a class, you use the `class` keyword with the name of the class (Ex "Vacation" )

  - Class body and method definitions
    - The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets `{}`. This is where you define class members, such as `methods` or `constructor`.

    - The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a `class`.
  
  - Sub classing with `extends`
    - The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations to create a `class` as a child of another `class`.

      ```javascript
      class Vacation {
        constructor(city, hotel){
        this.city = city;
        this.hotel = hotel;
        }
      }
      class Holiday extends Vaction{
        constructor(city, hotel);
        super(city,hotel);
      }
      ```
#### Routing

  - What is Routing?
    :refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. 

  - You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, [see app.METHOD](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.METHOD). You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) as the callback function.

  - These routing methods specify a callback function or (handler functions) called when the application receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method. The application "listens" for requests that match the specified routes and methods, and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback function.

  - The routing methods can have more than one callback function as arguments. It is important to provide `next` as an argument to the callback function and then call `next()` within the body of the function to hand off control to the next callback.

  - [Response methods lists](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) The methods on the response object (res) can send a response to the client, and terminate the request-response cycle. If none of these methods are called from a route handler, the client request will be left hanging.

#### Router in ExpressJS

  - What is `Router`?
    :is like a mini express application. It doesn't bring in views or settings, but provides us with the routing APIs like `.use`, `.get`, `.param`, and `route`.
  
  - Using the Router, we are allowed to make our applications more modular and flexible than ever before by creating multiple instances of the Router and applying them accordingly.

  - Route middleware in Express is a way to do something before a request is processed.

  - Route middleware for parameters can be used to validate data coming to your application.

  - **TIPS**
    - Use express.Router() multiple times to define groups of routes
    - Apply the express.Router() to a section of our site using `app.use()`
    - Use route middleware to process requests
    - Use route middleware to validate parameters using `.param()`
    - Use `app.route()` as a shortcut to the Router to define multiple requests on a route

### Review, Research, and Discussion

  1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
      - check user id
      - check data 
      - check user is authenticated

  2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?
      - True

  3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
      - must call next()

  4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you "inject" middleware?
      - functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. 

  5. What can cause express to error with "Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response"
      - means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header or statusCode. When you see this error, try to look for anything that tries to send a header after some of the body has already been written.

### Terms

  - Middleware
    :Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. 
      - Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
        - Execute any code.
        - Make changes to the request and the response objects.
        - End the request-response cycle.
        - Call the next middleware function in the stack.

  - Request Object
    : The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers.

  - Response Object
    : The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.

  - Application Middleware
    : Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the `app.use()` and `app.METHOD()` functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as `GET`, `PUT`, or `POST`) in lowercase.

  - Routing Middleware
    : Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().

  - Test Driven Development
    : (TDD) Test-driven development is the act of first deciding what you want your program to do, formulating a failing test, then writing the code to make that test pass. 

  - Behavioral Testing
    : that emphasizes developing features based on a user story and writing code that provides a solution to real problems

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    - middleware
    - Router
    - Express

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    - Testing
    - how to write better tests
    - running local server on machine

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    - I hoping i can get my database to run correctly
