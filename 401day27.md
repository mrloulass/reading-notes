### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?

  - Plain JS apps usually start with the initial UI created on the server (as HTML), whereas React apps start with a blank HTML page, and dynamically create the initial state in JavaScript.
 - React requires you to break your UI into components, but plain JS apps can be structured in any way you see fit.
 - Data for plain JS apps are stored in the DOM itself and has to be found from the DOM before it can be used. React apps store data in regular JavaScript variables
 - UI updates in plain JS have to happen by finding the DOM node to update and manually appending or removing elements. React automatically updates the UI based on setting and changing state within the component. [source](https://www.framer.com/blog/posts/react-vs-vanilla-js/)

2. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?
  
  - A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-functional-components-and-class-components-in-react/#:~:text=Functional%20Components-,Class%20Components,method%20used%20in%20functional%20components.)

### Terms

- Functional Components: are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function. These functions may or may not receive data as parameters. In the functional Components, the return value is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-functional-components/)

- Children / Child Components: are the components that inherit props from their parent components. You must import children or child components into the parent component.
