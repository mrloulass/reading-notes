# Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## 401 Reading Notes: Class 02

### Readings: Express

  - [Express/Node Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

    - What is Node?
      : runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript
      : running directly on a computer or server OS

    - What is Express?
      : web application framework for Node that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
      : Unopinionated framework(fewer restrictions)

  - [About NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)

    - What is NPM (Node Package Manager)?
      : package manager for the NodeJS platform
      : tool that allow you to install third party libraries

  - [TDD](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'tdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))

    - What is TDD(Test-driven development)?
      : is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

    - code -> test(writing unit tests) -> design (by refactoring code)

  - [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

    - What is CI/CD(Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery)?
      : continuous development, continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment and continuous monitoring of software applications throughout its development life cycle.

    - continuous integration
      1. ensure everyone's changes in code are integate
      2. catch bugs or errors
      3. reduce merge conflicts

### Review, Research, and Discussion

  1. What’s the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`? 
  
   - [PUT vs PATCH](https://rapidapi.com/blog/put-vs-patch/)
      - `PUT` updates the entire resource
      - `PATCH` updates part of a resource

  2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development like `json-server`

   - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
   - [Retool](https://docs.retool.com/docs)
   - [Mockend](https://mockend.com/)

  3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js? 
    
   - [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) can use on web and local machine - has more tools on pro site 
   - [APIdoc.js](https://apidocjs.com/) can be use on lolcal machine

  4. Compare and contrast `SOAP` and `ReST`

   - [SOAP vs ReST](https://www.guru99.com/comparison-between-web-services.html)
  
      - SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
      - SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern.
      - SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications while REST uses Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device.
      - SOAP needs more bandwidth for its usage whereas REST doesn’t need much bandwidth.
      - Comparing SOAP vs REST API, SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.
      - SOAP cannot make use of REST whereas REST can make use of SOAP.

  5. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

   - client errors use (400-499)
   - server errors use (500-599)

### Terms

   - Web Server 
     : a computer that runs websites. It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they are requisitioned. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

   - Express
     : web application framework for NodeJS

   - Routing
     : refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

   - WRRC(Web Request Response Cycle)
     : The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app.

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    - TDD
    - CI/CD
    - Express

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    - understaning testing
    - Express
    - Swagger

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    - Working more with express and coding the back-end of an api.
