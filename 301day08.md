## 301 Reading Notes: Class 08

### Readings:

1. [API Design Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

**Web API design** - Most modern web applications expose APIs that clients can use to interact with the application. Web API should try to:

  - Platform independence - Any client should be able to call the API, regardless of how the API is implemented internally. This requires using standard protocols, and having a mechanism whereby the client and the web service can agree on the format of the data to exchange.

  - Service evolution - The web API should be able to evolve and add functionality independently from client applications. As the API evolves, existing client applications should continue to function without modification. All functionality should be discoverable so that client applications can fully use it.

**Introduction to REST** - Representational State Transfer(REST)is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

**Organize the API around resources** - A resource is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it.

  - [Resources](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html)

**Define operations in terms of HTTP methods** - The HTTP protocol defines a number of methods that assign semantic meaning to a request.

  - [HTTP Methods](https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/)

    - Get : enables you to retrieve data from server

    - Post: enables you to add data to an existing file or resource in a server

    - Put: lets you replace an existing file or resource in a server

    - Delete: lets you delete data from server

    - Patch:For partial update

2. [SuperAgent Documentation](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/) - SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve.

3. **Regular Expression - (regex)** - are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.
