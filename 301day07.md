### Readings: Rest

1. [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

*Who is "Roy Fielding"?* - He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internet, and research on how the web works. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

- [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) - Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers

- HTTP tells the browser what protocol to use. It is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. It is like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

- The world wide web is built on an architectural style called (REST).

*What is REST?* - REpresentational State Transfer[REST](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest), is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

*What is a Resource?* - [Resource](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/restful/restful_resources.htm#:~:text=A%20resource%20in%20REST%20is,can%20understand%20the%20same%20format.) can be Text Files, Html Pages, Images, Videos or Dynamic Business Data. REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and modifies the resources. The most popular representations of resources are XML and JSON.

*What is the URL?* - A [Uniform Resource Locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (URL) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.

HTTP Methods

- Get : enables you to retrieve data from server

- Post: enables you to add data to an existing file or resource in a server

- Put: lets you replace an existing file or resource in a server

- Delete: lets you delete data from server

- Patch: For partial update

Web Development use web frameworks to change the data around for their websites.
