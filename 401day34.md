# Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## 401 Reading Notes: Class 34

### Reading: `<Login />` and `<Auth />`

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is the Context API useful?
  - enable components to share some data without explicitly passing via each component manually. Context is like a global object to the React component sub-tree.

2. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
  - no, it will throw an error

3. What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
  - 1. Themes: The ability to set the theme that provides dark mode and light mode which makes it easy to read in the low light situation.

  - 2. Multilingual application: To implement multiple languages in app we have to change the text in every component and replace with the translated text. 
  
  - 3. Authorization: setting the user role and info

4. Describe "Context Hell"
  - multiple Context Provider nested or wrap around each other
  ```javascript
  <AppContextProvider>
  <AnotherProvider>
    <AgainAnotherProvider configProp={false}>
      <TestProvider>
        <FooProvider>
          <BarProvider configHereAlso={someEnvronmentVar}>
            <BazProvider>
              <BatProvider>
                <App />
              </BatProvider>
            </BazProvider>
          </BarProvider>
        </FooProvider>
      </TestProvider>
    </AgainAnotherProvider>
  </AnotherProvider>
</AppContextProvider>;
```

### Terms

- global state: Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level, managing state in multiple components that are not directly connected.

- global context: is designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. 

- provider: component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.

- consumer: component that subscribes to context changes
