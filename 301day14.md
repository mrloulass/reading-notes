### Readings: Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

- Consider the history: [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

  1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
      
      - Personal computers started to show up in the U.S. homes in large numbers in 1984. The PC was marketed to boys and men not women in the 1980's. The whole tech culture was focus on men. Families would buy their sons PC, but not for their daughters even if they were interested in computers. People started to believe computers were for men only, but before 1984 women were out numbering men in computer science field.

  2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

      - Males had access to PCs at an early age allow them better understanding of PCs than women in college. If a women was in a computer science class the teacher would expect them know what the basic of a computer. Instead of helping women understand computers these professors discouraged them. This lead women out of the computer science field. In the 70's the intro classes assumed their students had no experience of computers and help them fully understand computers.

- Review the data: [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)

  1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

      - The top tech companies are mostly white males.

      - Amazon has more blacks than any other companies. 

      - Indiegogo has more women than other companies.

      - Latinos has not improve over the years.

      - The pace of diversity in tech for 2014-2017 is slow. Some companies are improving, but not all.

- Ask the question: [Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

  1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

      - Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

  2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

      - Diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, the research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

  3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
      
      - When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
