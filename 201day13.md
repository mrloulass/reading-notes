## Local Storage
[THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html)

[*What is Local Storage?*](https://www.jsdiaries.com/is-local-storage-persistent/)
: Similar to cookies, local storage is designed to a dependable, persistent browser data storage on the client side. However, it is not permanent. The data stored with it is specific to the user and their browser. While other web apps are unable to read from it. Local storage items are not sent along in network requests, which reduces overall network traffic. Local Storage can be thought of as a long term cache that will remain available within a particular browser. It is completely accessible by the user, they are free to clear it or modify it. There are also browser-specific ways of dealing with how persistent local storage is. How long the local storage lasts is dictated by the rules set out by the individual browser. Local storage remains persistent in different tabs/windows when the application is opened from the same domain.

### JSON

- [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

*What is JSON?*
:is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
