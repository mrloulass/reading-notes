### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the best practice for "pre-loading" data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
  - The way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method it needs to be handled with a reducer that puts it into your app store. This will require you to use some sort of a thunk middleware to handle the asynchronous action. Then you will use `mapStateToProps` to simply pass it down to the component that renders the data.

2. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
  - if this is a function, don't pass it to the reducer, wait for the function to finish first

### Terms

- middleware: is a function returning a function, which takes next as a parameter. Then the inner function returns another function which takes action as a parameter and finally returns next(action)

- thunk: A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. Allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.

Alternative State Managers

  - [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html): makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. The strategy to achieve that is simple: Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically. Conceptually MobX treats your application like a spreadsheet.

  - [HookState](https://hookstate.js.org/): The simple but incredibly fast and flexible state management that is based on React state hook
