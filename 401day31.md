### Reading: Hooks API

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

  - React is a single-page application, with a single-page app this  prevent a page from refresshing every time a link is clicked. You can ue React Router to act like a  multi-page app.

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
  - Outside the `<BrowserRouter/>`
    - Anything outside of this component will render on every page
  
3. What does props.children contain?
  - The content passed to a component through props.children can include
undefined, null, a Boolean, a number, a string, a React element, or an array of any of these types recursively. It can also be a function returning one of these types. [source](https://codeburst.io/a-complete-guide-to-props-children-in-react-c315fab74e7c)

### Terms

- Composition: where a more "specific" component renders a more "generic" one and configures it with props. Works equally well for components defined as classes

- Children / Child Components: children is a special prop, automatically passed to every component, that can be used to render the content included between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component

- Hash Routing: that uses the hash portion of the URL to keep your UI in sync with the URL.

- Link Routing: Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application
