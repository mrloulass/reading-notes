# Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## 401 Reading Notes: Class 17

### Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda

#### S3

  - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. 

#### Lambda

  - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

#### CDN

  - A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe "The Cloud"

  - The Cloud refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

  - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

3. What is auto-scaling?

  - Autoscaling is a cloud computing feature that enables organizations to scale cloud services such as server capacities or virtual machines up or down automatically, based on defined situations such as traffic ir utilization levels.

4. What is bandwidth?

  - bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?

  - Cloud services pricing can charge on a per-hour, per-minute, or per-second basis. When you move to the cloud's on-demand pricing models, everything is based on the amount of time you use it.

### Terms

- Server Instances: a server running our application over the cloud

- Containers: are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment.

- Cloud Services: are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet

- Cloud Architecture: are the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, and applications engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems.

- AWS(Amazon Web Services): providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: s that they have comparable features and pricing. One big difference is that Herokuâ€™s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features, e.g., auto-scaling, where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear. On the other hand, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve. [source](https://codeburst.io/heroku-v-s-aws-elastic-beanstalk-1cc6f12ca3c7)
