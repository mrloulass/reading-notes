  #### [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

  - **A Simple Set of Steps to Follow**

      1. Read the problem completely twice.
        - This is an important step
        - If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it
        - Better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.

      2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
        - make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case.
        - write out all the things you are normally thinking about in your head
        - write down each little step

      3. Optimize the manual steps.
        - figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier
        - there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

      4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
        - capture all the steps we created and put them into our editor as comments
        - write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

      5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
        - If you struggle here these are the reasons:
          1. You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
            - go back to steps 2 write out each and every single step
          2. You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion
            - With any code language be able to solve algorithm type problems like:
              * Create a list
              * Sort a list or array
              * Create a map or dictionary
              * Loop through a list, or dictionary
              * Parse strings
              * Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

      6. Optimize the real code.
        - if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.
        - make sure variables and methods have meaningful names.
        - get rid of duplication.
  
  - **A Few Final Tips**
    - have confidence in this process.
    - practice,practice,practice
    - divide large problems in sections to solve them

  #### [Act like you make $1000/hr](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)

  - Most people value their time far less than it’s worth.
    - They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take.
    - They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.
  
  - Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.
    - You would become more productive, focused, and effective.

  - To be successful work on being more focus than busy all the time
    - don't waste time on busywork or distractions
    - focus on your goals every day

  - You teach people how to treat you.
    - If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat your time the same.
    - If you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will treat your time the same.

  - Learn to say No more
    - Every time you say Yes to every thing, it means you’re saying No to other opportunities.
    - But say Yes to a few great things

 - *The process of weeding out good for the truly great opportunities is easier when you value your time at $1,000/hour. Anything you can honestly justify doing for $1,000/hour is probably a great thing for your goals.*

 - *When you value your time, the more important and productive work you’ll do and your task will be less trivial and mindless.*
  
  #### [How to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)
  
  - *To think like a programmer is to problem solve more effectively*

  - **Have a Framework to problem solve**
   
   1. Understand
    - You should write down your problem, draw a diagram, or talk to someone about the problem
    - When you can explain your problem in plain English you understand the problem

   2. Plan
    - Analyze the problem and process the information to get a good plan
    - EX: what is input X and what steps to return or get an output Y
    - Use Comments to write steps in your code 

   3. Divide
    - Do not try to solve one big problem.
    - break it into sub-problems
    - solve each sub-problem one by one
    - Connecting all your sub-solutions this will give you the solution to the original problem

   4. If Stuck
    - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
    - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.
    - Research: Google and learn from other people's solutions

   5. Practice (problem solving skills)
    - math problems
    - video games
    - code challenges

  #### [The 5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

  - How to Use the 5 Whys

    1. Assemble a Team
      - People who are familiar with the specifics of the problem and with the process that you're trying to fix.

    2. Define the Problem
      - Observe the problem in action
      - Discuss it with your team
      - Write your problem statement on a whiteboard or sticky note

    3. Ask the First "Why?"
      - Ask your team why the problem is occurring
      - Search for answers that are grounded in fact not guesses
      - Write down meaningful phrases versus vague words
    
    4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
      - For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
      - Method also allows you to follow multiple lanes of inquiry
    
    5. Know When to Stop
      - You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses
      - If you're not sure that you've uncovered the real root cause, try more in-depth problem-solving technique like:
        * [Cause and Effect Analysis](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_03.htm)
        * [Root Cause Analysis](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_80.htm) 
        * [FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_82.htm)
      
    6. Address the Root Cause(s)
      - Discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

    7. Monitor Your Measures
      - How effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem.
      - You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely
      - If this happens again repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.

  #### [What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

  - What is JavaScript?: 
    - a single threaded (it can do one thing at a time) programming language
    - single threaded Runtime
    - it has a single call stack. 
    - the program can run one piece of code at a time.

  - What is Call Stack?:
    - data structure which records where in the program we are at

  - What happens when things are slow?:
    - blocking

  - The web browser helps run things simultaneously
    - Call Stack
    - Web APIs
    - Task Queue(Callback Queue)
    - Console
    - Event Loop

  - What is the Event Loop job?:
    - Is to look at the call stack and look at the task queue
    - If the stack is empty it takes the first thing on the task queue and pushes it on to the call stack which effectively run it.

  - What can a Callback do?:
    - can be any function that another function calls
    - an asynchronous callback as in one that will get pushed back on the callback queue in the future
