### Readings: Event Driven Applications

#### Event-Driven Programming in Node.js

What is Event-Driven Programming? 
`is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision.`

  - Example: In The Web Browser:
    - when you click a button a `click` event is triggered.
    - when pressa key a `keydown` event is triggered
    - These events have associated functions that, when triggered, are executed to make a change to the user interface in some way.

  - Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:
    - An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
    - A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

[EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) is a Node.js module that allows us to incorporated Event-Driven Programming in our project.

  - other npm Event-Driven Programming
    - [EventEmitter2](https://github.com/EventEmitter2/EventEmitter2)
    - [EventEmitter3](https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3)

  - We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported we’ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.
    `const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const myEventEmitter = new EventEmitter;`

  - We’ll write a function that will act as our event listener, hen we can use EventEmitters `on` method to set the listener.

  - EventEmitter has an `emit` method that we we use to trigger the event

Removing Listeners when you want to remove an event listener from an event. `removeListener` or `removeAllListeners`

Object Oriented Programming + Event-Driven Programming: The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.


### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important?

  - Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.[source: access control](https://www.inform-consult.com/why-is-access-control-important/)

2. Describe an application that would need access control.

  - Login credentials (such as usernames and passwords).
  - PINs and one-time passwords (OTPs).
  - Virtual private network (VPN) access to internal networks.

3. What is a role used for?

  - assign particular access to a user base on their role.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

  - there is no way to provide individual users additional permissions over and above those available for their role.
  - this help contain security leaks

### Terms

- Authorization: It's a process of granting or denying access to resources.
Mostly it happens after Authentatication.

- Role Based Access Control(RBAC): RBAC grants access based on defined business functions rather than the individual user’s identity. The goal is to provide users with access only to data that’s been deemed necessary for their role within the organizations. This widely used method is based on a complex combination of role assignments, authorizations, and permissions.

- Capabilities: defines our (ACL) after a user model is build
