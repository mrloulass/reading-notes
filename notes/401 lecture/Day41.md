## Mobile App development

- native Software development ( particularly for mobile)
  - In the browser we don't have native code
    - Chrome / your browser is the thing that is interfacing with your computer
      - our JS that runs in the browser is dynamic
  - The Elements that make up a UI in Native Code are already preprogrammed, we just need to import them and configure
    - This will cause frustration as we can  no longer be as "dynamic" with code running natively vs code running in the browser

- Running App while developing
  - run either on your device, or in a device emulator (Xcode, Android Studio)
