## Class 28: useReducer 

A function, that sysmatically / standardized updates state (some object / compound data structure)
- 3 pieces to using a reducer;
  - reducer function, that when given the appropriate data / values, is resposible for updating the state
  - initial State, this is the original shape of our state, think property names / keys, and their values.
  - lastly are actions, these are functions that are run by components to update the state managed by the reducer
    - functions that return objects with 2 parts
     - type: tells the reducer what event has occured
     - payload: any data associated with the event
- The reason we use reduce to keep our state a specific shape
