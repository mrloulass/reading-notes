### Readings: Component Based UI

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

  - 1. [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) is a open-source framework by Google that works for both desktop and mobile.

  - 2. [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and  can be integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

  - 3. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs) is a famework that shifts work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. Whereas traditional frameworks do the bulk of their work in the browser. Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.

  - 4. [Ember.js](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/) is an open-source JavaScript web framework, utilizing a component-service pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page web applications by incorporating common idioms, best practices, and patterns from other single-page-app ecosystem patterns into the framework.

  - 5. [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/home) is a framework that allows you to  build components using vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript. It composed of smaller modules, allowing developers to pick and choose the pieces that work for them, or to use the framework in its entirety.

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?[source](https://sofienebk.medium.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-library-2b712a1a1c41)

  - a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides you with a few places to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

  - a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library.

### Terms

- Rendering: refers to showing the output in the browser

- Templates: are sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces.

- State: is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
