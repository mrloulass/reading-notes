#### AWS

  - What is AWS?
    - Amazon Web Services (AWS) providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide a variety of basic abstract technical infrastructure and distributed computing building blocks and tools.
    
#### SNS vs SQS

  - What is SNS?
    - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication.

  - What is SQS?
    - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

|                                      Do other systems care about an event?                                      	|                Does your system car about an event?                	|



### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

- Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once.

- FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it. Duplicates are not introduced into the queue.

2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

- Using message queues, you can send, store, and receive messages between application components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available.

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

- Event Notification

4. How do you test an event driven system?

- There are multiple levels of tests you will typically write for your system. In the most canonical case, you will write unit tests, service tests, and end-to-end tests. In each of these cases, your System Under Test (SUT, what is actually being tested) comprises a different part of your application.

### Terms

FIFO Queue: A FIFO queue is a queue that operates on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. This means that the request is processed in the order in which it arrives.

Pub/Sub: Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic. Pub/sub messaging can be used to enable event-driven architectures, or to decouple applications in order to increase performance, reliability and scalability.
