### Readings: Bearer Authorization

#### JSON Web Token (JWT)

  - What is JSON Web Token?

    - is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

  - How JWT is created 
  - Why is JWT used?
    - Securely transfer information between any two parties
  - Where JWT is used
  - What is JWT Payload
  - What is JWT Header

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:

  - 1. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
  - 2. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
  - 3. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
  - 4. Receive authorization code
  - 5. Make a request to the access token endpoint
  - 6. Receive access token 
  - 7. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
  

2. What can you do with an authorization code?

  - is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token.

3. What can you do with an access token?

  - is the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user

4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

  - with OAuth the application never sees the username/password

### Terms

- Client ID: is a public identifier for apps

- Client Secret: is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server.

- Authentication Endpoint: obtain an authorization code

- Access Token Endpoint: obtain a token 

- API Endpoint: is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting.

- Authorization Code: is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token.

- Access Token: is the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user.
