## Object Literals

*What is an Object*

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of anything that you can recognize  from the real world. In an Objects the variables and function are name differently
1. variable is called **property**
2. function is called **method**

example of an Object:

`let home = {`
  `location: 'Seattle',`
  `floors: 3,`
  `color: 'bluegreen',`
  `houseType:['townhome','high rise', 'single family'],`
  `checkColor: function(){`
    `return this.color;`
  `}`
`};`

## Document Object Model (DOM)

*What is a DOM?*

- The **DOM** tells the browsers how to create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 

- When the browser loads a web page it creats a model of the page in mermory. The **DOM** tells the browser how to structure  the model using a **DOM tree**. 

- The **DOM** is called an object model because the model (**the DOM tree**) is made of objects. Each object represent a different part of the page loaded in the browser window.

- You can access and change the HTML page with the **DOM**. The **DOM** can define methods and properties to access and update each object in this model. This will update what the user see in the browser.
