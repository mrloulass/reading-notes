## Object Literals

*What is an Object*

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of anything that you can recognize  from the real world. In an Objects the variables and function are name differently
1. variable is called **property**
2. function is called **method**

example of an Object:

```JavaScript
let home = {
  location: 'Seattle',
  floors: 3,
  color: 'bluegreen',
  houseType:['townhome','high rise', 'single family'],
  checkColor: function(){
    return this.color;
  }
};
```

## Document Object Model (DOM)

*What is a DOM?*

- The **DOM** tells the browsers how to create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 

- When the browser loads a web page it creats a model of the page in mermory. The **DOM** tells the browser how to structure  the model using a **DOM tree**. 

- The **DOM** is called an object model because the model (**the DOM tree**) is made of objects. Each object represent a different part of the page loaded in the browser window.

- You can access and change the HTML page with the **DOM**. The **DOM** can define methods and properties to access and update each object in this model. This will update what the user see in the browser.

## DOM TREE is made up of nodes

- The Documnet Node - at the top of the tree, represents the entire web page to access any part of the **DOM TREE** you start with Document Node 

- Element Nodes - are next on the tree and represents the structure of the HTML page

- Attribute Nodes - are open tags of HTML elements and are not children of the element, but part of the element

- Text Nodes - can not have children and a child of the containing element 

## Working with the DOM TREE

1. Access the elements

 - Select an individual element node `getElementId()` and `querySelector`()
 - use **document.** to access individual elements and add id name in the parameter () of the method

 - Select multiple elements (Nodelist) `getElementsByClassName()`, `getElementsByTagName()` and `querrySelectorAll()` 

 - Traversing between element nodes `parentNode`, `previousSibling`/ `nextSibling` and `firstChild`/ `lastChild`

2. Work with those Elements

 - Access/Update text nodes `nodeValue`

 - Work with HTML content `innerHTML`, `textContent`, `ceateElement()`, `createTextnode()` and `appendChild`/ `removeChild`

 - Access/Update attribute values `className`/ `id`, `hasAttribute()`, `getAttribute()`, `setAttribute()`, and `removeAttribut()`
