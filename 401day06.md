### Readings: Authentication

**Basic Authentication** is a common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request. 

  - In a node application, we can use a node module - `base-64` to do the work of decoding password strings coming from a login attempt in a browser

**Password Encryption**

- Never (ever) store passwords in plain text
- Encryption is a one-way string transformation
- Use a secure hashing algorithm (such as `bcrypt`) to transform/encrypt passwords
- The only way to validate a password is to re-hash it and see if the hashes match or are equivalent

**Securing Passwords with Bcrypt Hashing Function**

- Cryptographic hash algorithms MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3 are general purpose hash functions, designed to calculate a digest of huge amounts of data in as short a time as possible.

- The benefit of hashing is that if someone steals the database with hashed passwords, they only make off with the hashes and not the actual plaintext passwords.

- PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH ALGORITHM

  - Brute Force attack:Hashes can't be reversed, an attacker can simply keep trying different inputs until they do find the right one that generates the same hash value, called brute force attack.

  - Hash Collision attack:Hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, so there is inevitably going to be the possibility of two different inputs that produce the same output hash.

**BCrypt, IT's SLOW AND STRONG**

  - Key Stretching: algorithms which can make the brute force attacks slower and minimize the impact.

    - PBKDF2
    - BCrypt

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

  - is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

  - instantiation of a class to one object

3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

  1. I would `require()` the middleware in my app.
  2. Next attach middleware to the HTTP req,res for each route
  3. Now the middleware can terminate the HTTP req or pass a another middleware function.

### Term

- Router Middleware :
take the original request, and forward it to a sub handler according to the path example : "/home" for a GET request is mapped to function getHome that handle it and eventually send a response to the client on the behalf of the original handler.

- Dynamic Module Loading:
 a program that can, at run time, load a library into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory. 

- Singleton Pattern:
limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. (ex. the route handler in Express)

- CRUD -> REST Method Matches
  - Create = PUT 
      - = POST 
  - Read   = GET
  - Update = PUT with an existing URI
  - Delete = DELETE

- Mock Testing:
creating a fake version of an external or internal service that can stand in for the real one, helping your tests run more quickly and more reliably

### Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

  - CRUD to REST
  - Middleware
  - Express server

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

  - Testing
  - Code Challenges
  - proper way to follower the data in your code

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

  - displaying the data on my server
