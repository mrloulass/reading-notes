### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux "Ducks"
- Ducks pattern suggests keeping all Redux functionality in a single file. This file will export a reducer function by default along with all actions creators and constants, if required. It also suggests the pattern for action types.

- RTK follows the ducks pattern and combines reducers, actions, and constants in one file called a slice. Each slice will provide an initial state and a reducer function for an object in store. So our component that provides the data, which is a duck now

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
- Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code

### Terms

- redux toolkit slices: 
A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. 

- namespace: an action that carries a payload of information from your application to store.
