### Review, Research, and Discussion

  1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

    - Better program design and higher code quality.
    - Detailed project documentation. 
    - TDD reduces the time required for project development. 
    - Code flexibility and easier maintenance.
    - With TDD you will get a reliable solution. 
    
  2. In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?

    - `beforeEach()` is often useful if you want to reset some global state that will be used by many tests.
    - `afterEach()` is often useful if you want to clean up some temporary state that is created by each test.

  3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

    - slow process 

  4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
  
    - The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

    - A child of an ES6 class is another type definition which extends the parent with new properties and methods, which in turn can be instantiated at runtime. A child of a prototype is another object instance which delegates to the parent any properties that aren’t implemented on the child.

  5. Why REST?

    1. REST is Easy to Understand and Implement
    2. REST Makes your Application More Scalable
        - No State
        - Faster Data Interchange Format
    3. Caching is Easier with REST
    4. REST is Flexibile

### Terms

  - functional programming
    :is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects.

  - object-oriented programming (OOP)
    :is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects

  - class
    :is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data.

  - `super()`
    :method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods

  - `this`
    :refers to the instance object itself in a constructor

  - Test Driven Development (TDD)
    :(TDD) Test-driven development is the act of first deciding what you want your program to do, formulating a failing test, then writing the code to make that test pass. 

  - Jest
    :is a JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

  - Continuous Integration (CI)
    :is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.

  - REST
    :(Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

  - Data Model
    :The process of taking a real world or conceptual idea and encoding it into Javascript's built in data types. Models typically describe the physical characteristics (properties) and behaviors (methods) of an object in a way that you can write code that uses your models to problem solve and create applications.

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

  - When use a dev branch for our labs we are doing Continuous Integration.
  - using REST
  - I understand Middleware much more

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

  - more about testing
  - how to use Sequelize with Postgres
  - understanding the connections with testing and coding

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

  - Building a data model
