## 401 Reading Notes: Class 27

### Readings: Component Lifecycle / `useEffect()` Hook

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

  - React is a single-page application, with a single-page app this  prevent a page from refresshing every time a link is clicked. You can ue React Router to act like a  multi-page app.

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and 
why?

  - Outside the `<BrowserRouter/>`
    - Anything outside of this component will render on every page

3. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

  - Each router creates a history object that it uses to keep track of the current location and re-renders the application whenever this location changes. For this reason, the other React Router components rely on this history object being present; which is why they need to be rendered inside a router.

4. What does props.children contain?
  
  - The content passed to a component through props.children can include
undefined, null, a Boolean, a number, a string, a React element, or an array of any of these types recursively. It can also be a function returning one of these types. [source](https://codeburst.io/a-complete-guide-to-props-children-in-react-c315fab74e7c)

5. How do `useState()` and `this.setState()` differ?

  - `useState()` is use to set a hook for functional Componet and use `prods` to pass to child

  - `this.setState()` is use to set state for a Class component and use `this.prods` to pass to child

### Terms

- State Hook: are functions that let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks donâ€™t work inside classes.

- Mounting and Un-Mounting: A React component's lifecycle contains distinct phases for creation and deletion. In coding terms, these are called mounting and unmounting. You can also think of them as "setup" and "cleanup".
  - `componentWillMount` and `componentDidMount` lifecycle methods in the mounting phase
  - `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method in the unmounting phase [source](https://learn.co/lessons/react-component-mounting-and-unmounting)

  - you can use React hooks to do Mounting and Un-Mounting with `useEffect`
